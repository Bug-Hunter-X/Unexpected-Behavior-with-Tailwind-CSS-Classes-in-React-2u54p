# Unexpected Tailwind CSS Behavior in React

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes appear to be ignored or rendered incorrectly in a React application.  The problem stems from an incorrect setup or configuration of Tailwind in the project.

## Problem

The `main.js` file contains a simple React component that uses Tailwind CSS classes (`bg-blue-500`, `hover:bg-blue-700`, `text-white`, `font-bold`, `py-2`, `px-4`, `rounded`).  However, the styles may not be applied correctly, leading to unexpected visual results.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying that Tailwind CSS is properly configured within the React project. This includes confirming the installation, configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`), and the inclusion of the stylesheet in your main application file.
